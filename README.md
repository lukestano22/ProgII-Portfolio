# Student Data Entry and File Output Program

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This Java program allows users to enter student data â€” including name, address, and GPA â€” through a command-line interface. Each student is stored in a `LinkedList`, and after data entry is complete, the list is sorted in ascending order by student name and saved to a plain-text file called `students.txt`.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Object-oriented design using a custom `Student` class
- Input validation for numeric GPA (must be between 0.0 and 4.0)
- Dynamic storage using `LinkedList`
- Sorting by name using the `Comparable` interface
- Output to a plain-text file viewable in any text editor (e.g., Notepad)

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Command-line terminal or IDE that supports Java
